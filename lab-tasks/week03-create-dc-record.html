Create a (valid) Dublin Core Record.
<p>Choose an object - a book, CD, chair, etc - and describe it to the best of your ability using the 15 elements defined as the <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/">Dublin Core Metadata Element Set</a>.</p>
<br />
<p>You should use XML to encode your record and it should conform to, and validate against, the XML Schema defined by the Open Archives Initiative (OAI).  You can use the little app, pre-loaded with a base record, at <a href="http://3windmills.com/lsc615/xml-edit-validate/">http://3windmills.com/lsc615/xml-edit-validate/</a>.  You may use any other XML Validation tool you prefer (Oxygen XML, Netbeans IDE, XML Spy, etc) but it should validate against this specific XSD: <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd">http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd</a></p>.
<br />
<p>Please upload your XML record to this week's discussion board and explore, in 300-400 words, the types of issues you encountered using Dublin Core to describe your object.  What types of cataloging decisions did you have to make?  Was it always clear what you were recording/describing?  Could you use all the elements?  Did you want/need more?  How well do you think someone else would understand your record?<p>
