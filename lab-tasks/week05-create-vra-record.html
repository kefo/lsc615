Create a (valid) VRA Record.
<p>Choose an image of some kind - it may be of artwork or of some other museum-like object - and describe it to the best of your ability using the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/vracore/">Visual Resources Association (VRA) schema</a>.  In addition to the introductory document in your readings, you will also need to consult the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/vracore/VRA_Core4_Outline.pdf">VRA Core4 Outline</a> and the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/vracore/VRA_Core4_Element_Description.pdf">VRA Core4 Element Description</a>.  The latter will be more useful, but the former is part cheatsheet and introductory document.</p>
<br />
<p>You should use XML to encode your record and it should conform to, and validate against, the XML Schema defined by the VRA.  You can use the little app, pre-loaded with a base record, at <a href="http://3windmills.com/lsc615/xml-edit-validate/">http://3windmills.com/lsc615/xml-edit-validate/</a>.  You may use any other XML Validation tool you prefer (Oxygen XML, Netbeans IDE, XML Spy, etc) but it should validate against this specific XSD: <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/vracore/vra.xsd">http://www.loc.gov/standards/vracore/vra.xsd</a>.</p>

<p>Please upload your XML record to this week's discussion board and explore, in 300-400 words, the types of issues you encountered using VRA to describe your object.  What types of cataloging decisions did you have to make?  Was it always clear what you were recording/describing?  Could you use all the elements?  Did you want/need more?  How well do you think someone else would understand your record?</p>
<br />
<p>How does VRA differ from MODS or Dublin Core?  Is that difference notable and, if so, why?</p>
