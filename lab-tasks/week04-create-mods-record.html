Create a (valid) MODS Record.
<p>Choose an object - a book, CD, museum-like object, archival collection, etc - and describe it to the best of your ability using the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/">Metadata Object Description Schema (MODS)</a>.  You will need all of your readings for this week for this lab task.</p>
<br />
<p>You should use XML to encode your record and it should conform to, and validate against, the XML Schema defined by the Library of Congress.  You can use the little app, pre-loaded with a base record, at <a href="http://3windmills.com/lsc615/xml-edit-validate/">http://3windmills.com/lsc615/xml-edit-validate/</a>.  You may use any other XML Validation tool you prefer (Oxygen XML, Netbeans IDE, XML Spy, etc) but it should validate against this specific XSD: <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/v3/mods-3-5.xsd">http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/v3/mods-3-5.xsd</a>.</p>
<br />
<p>Please upload your XML record to this week's discussion board and explore, in 300-400 words, the types of issues you encountered using MODS to describe your object.  What types of cataloging decisions did you have to make?  Was it always clear what you were recording/describing?  Could you use all the elements?  Did you want/need more?  How well do you think someone else would understand your record?  MODS has a "relatedItem" element: did you need to use it (and did you)?</p>
<br />
<p>Notably, since you can now, spend a few words comparing this experience to your experience with Dublin Core.</p>
<br />
<p>Since I am only posting this Sunday, let's have it due by Thursday at 5 PM instead of the normal day (Wednesday).  Naturally, submitting it early is always OK.</p>
