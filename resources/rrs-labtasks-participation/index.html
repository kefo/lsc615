<h3>Reading responses, class participation, and lab tasks are worth 40% of your overall course grade.</h3>
<br />
<br />
<h4>5 Reading Responses (50%)</h4>
<p>You are responsible for writing brief, three to five paragraph (400-500 words) topical reading responses for <u>five</u> (5) class sessions. Please post these to the forum set up for the week's discussion by <b>11:59 pm</b> on the Monday following the "class date," which is the date indicated on the syllabus (every Saturday).</p>
<br />
<p>Include Reading Response #N in the subject line, so it will be clear which of your posts is to be evaluated as a reading response. You must designate this before you turn it in, that is, you can’t decide the following week that you want to be graded on the post you left the previous week. (You may, of course, post to the forum or add to discussion anytime, and these will not be counted as submitted reading responses.)</p>
<br />
<p>Please focus only on the readings assigned for the week. These responses will provide an opportunity to demonstrate your ability to synthesize concepts, theories and practices covered in this course. Therefore, your writing ought to show that you have read the article(s) and thought about them, but it should not be a simple summary of what is in the article or reading(s).</p>
<br />
<p>Here are some guidelines: You may write about a single article or about a single topic, which brings in several of the readings. You may include references to other materials from outside of the class readings; if you do, please include a full citation. When you present a viewpoint or argument, you must support this with evidence from the articles or class materials.  Tell us why you are focusing on this topic for the reading response – explain (briefly) how or why is it important. When drawing parallels or making connections, explain the nature of the connection.  Qualitative criticisms of the readings are acceptable provided you make a clear argument and provide examples to back it up. </p>
<br />
<p>Important: Suggest questions for the week’s asynchronous discussion. The idea is to pose questions that might stimulate a reader who has already done the readings to think about them further (e.g. how the concepts or arguments relate to readings from earlier in the semester; specific ways that given readings for the week might complement or contradict each other; how ideas from the week’s readings might be applied in particular professional situations). You should not generate questions that would simply prompt the reader to provide a factual response.</p>
<br />
<p>Assessment will be based on evidence of engagement with issue(s) related to the weekly topic. Each response is worth a possible 5 points.   While these reading responses are short pieces that you will post to the class Forums, please approach them as you would a longer formal paper. </p>
<br />
<br />
<h4>Participation (30%)</h4>
<p>Although we meet four times in-person, this is largely an asynchronous class, so I expect class discussion and interaction to happen in the weekly forums.  Participation will largely be evaluated based on your contributions to online discussions (whether writing a response paper, commenting, or otherwise posting to the forums).  To a lesser extent your participation will be based on in-class participation, simply because we meet in-person only 4 times.  Please note that the <b>quality</b> of your contributions counts.  Informed comments, thoughtful exchanges with your fellow students and demonstrating your interest and engagement with the assignments, reading materials, and general topics are the sure path to a good participation grade.</p>
<br />
<br />
<h4>Lab tasks (20%)</h4>
You will periodically be given lab tasks.  This are designed to be relatively simple tasks.  As with everything else, quality counts.  Lab tasks should be completed by <b>11:59 pm</b> on the Wednesday following the "class date," which is the date indicated on the syllabus (every Saturday).
