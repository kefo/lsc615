<h2>Assignment 2 - Metadata Schema Development (30% of overall grade)</h2>
<br />
<p>
As a group, you will design a metadata schema for a particular type of content.  
It will be important to identify, very early, the "who" and "what" questions this 
project raises.  Who will be using your metadata schema, why, and what 
information must you capture in order to serve those users and their needs?  
Recognize that not all of your metadata's users will be patrons looking for 
content.  Users will also likely be catalogers, reference librarians, and IT 
staffs, all of whom may have different requirements of the data (if not the 
actual object the data describes).  What do all of these users need in order 
to manage the resource?   Are there rules and guidelines implementers should 
follow in order to best achieve specific goals, which may range from a user 
searching a system to two libraries exchanging records.  In short, remember 
that not all metadata is descriptive.  
</p>
<br />
<p>
You need to create a "primer" document that introduces and provides a high-level 
overview of your schema.  In it, you should lay out answers - at a high-level - 
to all the facets mentioned above and any other you think of as you progress.  
You will also need to fashion an XML format for your metadata.  As with all 
good metadata schemas, you will need to define each of the elements and attributes 
used in your schema.  Think of it as an element/attribute dictionary.  Your 
elements/attributes and the overall construction of your XML should make 
semantic sense.  For example, if you feel the need to create an element 
for an "alternate" or "variant" title, it would be unwise to call that 
element "secondTitle" because you could have made a better semantic choice, 
one that would have been more intuitive to an implementer.  (For the record, 
I know in class I said you may only need 15 elements, but we also know how far 
15 elements gets us, which is to say, not very far at all.  I expect you will 
need to define a good many more than 15 elements/attributes to describe your 
chosen content types.)  By now you also know how important example records are, 
so you will need to include example records.  Although you do not need to create a 
formal XML schema (XSD), which could be used for validation purposes, your example 
XML records should be consistent from one to another (for example, if you use 
birthDate - uppercase 'D' - in one example record, it would be wrong to use 
birthdate - lowercase 'd' - in another example record).  Of course, all of your 
XML examples should be well-formed.    Ultimately, someone who encounters your 
introductory document, element/attribute dictionary, and example records should 
be able to gain a good understanding of what your metadata schema is designed for 
and for whom.  Each group will give a short presentation (10 minutes) about its 
metadata schema during our last on-campus class. 90% of this assignment's grade 
will be based on these group outputs.    
</p>
<br />
<p>
The final 10 percent of your grade will be a short 400-500 word essay in which 
you should address any challenges to the project.  This is an individual aspect
of this assignment, not a group component, so each student will complete his/her 
own essay.  It will be turned in separately from the group parts. I'm absolutely not 
interested in a "so-and-so did this and so-and-so did that and the project would have been 
better...."  I'm interested in you addressing the human component that comes 
with the creation of metadata schemas, specifically with an eye toward the 
respective roles humans and technology play when it comes to metadata schema 
creation, and success.
